# Javascript30 Lessons

This project is my #javascript30 course by [Wes Bos](//github.com/wesbos). It's not meant to be the end all be all. , just what I'm learning and some skills I want to work on.

## Getting Started

If you too want to take the course head over to the [#javascript30](javascript30.com) site where you can get started.

### Prerequisites

You, a computer, the [starter files](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30), and nothing else. No libraries, frameworks, helpers. Just you and some Javascript!

I used bootstrap for the site layout but that's it.
